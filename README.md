petition = client.petitions.get(petition_id)
puts petition.title

# Update a Petition
client.petitions.update(petition_id, {description: 'An updated description'})

# Create a Signature on a Petition
signature = client.signatures.create(petition_id: petition_id,
                                     signature_data: {comments: 'This is so important'},

# Retrieve a Signature
signature = client.signatures.get(petition_id: petition_id, id: signature_id)
